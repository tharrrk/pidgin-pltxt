# pidgin-pltxt
Send plaintext messages from Pidgin (jwchat.org compatibility)

Based on excellent b64 simple perl plugin by Chetan Vaity

Just place into ~/.purple/plugins

Not even a restart of pidgin is needed - just enable and select account(s) to be used with.

I don't plan to update this any more. I did this once I found jwchat.org is not displaying
messages with formatting AT ALL. It simply ignores them. And searching through the internet,
finding several feature requests to pidgin to support this.

https://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/15081

And finding jwchat is being discontinued :( Sigh...

The only client side JS webclient that allows entering server and port.
